working on:

databse.py

    check_database()

        i need to check if the database exists, if not, create it also i need to save data that is needed for startup like the database path and the database name i need to find 
        a way to save this data in a file that is not the database file itself, so i can read it before the database is created or connected to

app.py

    class AccountManagerApp(QtWidgets.QWidget):
    def __init__(self):

        loading database path and name from the file
        as well as loading settings and runtine data

    setup_new_user_ui()

    encription_toggle()
    database_path()
    rest_time()

    Backround for main window not working well with the rest of the app

    account on home page is not deselected when switching to another page

    groups are not setup 

    add an info page that shows the user how to use the app check for updates and other info like github page wiki and contact info and credits for the app

login.py
    rethink the cdn for the background image / links.txt file as the links files keeps giving errors when being pulled from the cdn

code_claim.py 

    create a new class that will be used to claim codes and check if they are valid

    add codes and a code verisoning system to the cdn and the app so that codes can be updated and changed without breaking the app and users can claim codes and get rewards based on what the admins upload to the cnd 

proxy.py
    
    work on the proxy class and make sure that it is working correctly and that it is not leaking any data

    see if accouns need to be run though spific proxies for a given region or if they can be claimed from any region
