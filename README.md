# Hoyo Helper (backend)

Hoyo Helper (backend) is a project designed to serve as a CDN (Content Delivery Network) for small photo assets, bits of code, and collections of links stored in dictionaries.
This project is particularly useful so we can keep the client exe (main brach) small as well giving me an easy way to host and retrieve various assets and data.

## Features

- **Asset Hosting**: Hosts image assets in a structured directory for easy access and management.
- **Code Snippets**: Contains useful bits of code for common tasks, such as fetching and displaying assets.
- **Link Dictionaries**: Organizes links in text files as dictionaries for easy retrieval and use in applications.

- **Hoyo Reward Codes**: This is unmilmented, but there will be a way to look up hoyo Reward Codes for the client (main brach) to run on account that are logged in.

## Getting Started

To get started with Hoyo Helper (backend), you can clone the repository to your local machine or directly use the assets and code snippets hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Cloning the Repository
