    @param password (str) - The code you provided is an asynchronous function that uses Playwright to
    automate logging into a website and retrieving cookies. It seems like you were about to provide
    information about the `password` parameter but it got cut off. If you need any assistance with
    completing the code or have any specific questions, feel free
    @param username (str) - The `username` parameter in the `get_cookie` function is used to specify the
    username of the account for which you want to retrieve the authentication cookie. This username will
    be used to log in to the specified website and obtain the necessary cookies for authentication.
    @returns A list of dictionaries containing cookies is being returned if the login is successful. If
    the login fails, it will return False.
